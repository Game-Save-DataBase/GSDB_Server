#THIS FILE REQUIRES ALL VARIABLES TO BE FILLED IN TO RUN THE SERVER AND TO BE RENAMED TO ".env" 
#The parameters that must be filled in for proper functioning are the private keys to access VirusTotal, IGDB, and MongoDB.
#Additionally, private keys must be generated for use in GSDB.
#To know how to obtain each of the required private keys, go to the introduction section in GSDB Wiki or follow the steps in this same file.
#https://github.com/Game-Save-DataBase/GSDB_Server/wiki
#Once all the necessary information is filled in, this file must be renamed to ".env" and placed in the root of the project.

#---------------------------------------------------------PRIVATE KEYS AND CONNECTIONS-------------------------------------------------------------

#...............GSDB SECRET KEYS
#To generate GSDB private keys it is recommended to use the following bash command:
#> openssl rand -hex 32
#These keys must not be extracted from any service as they are keys generated for the GSDB project.

#for session and encrypting

#..............MONGODB CREDENTIALS
#To connect to the MongoDB database you need to set the connection string. The connection may change depending of the setup:
#- MongoDB Atlas (free cloud service from MongoDB) -> example: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
#- Locally stored MongoDB Database -> example: mongodb://localhost:27017/gsdb
#- Stored in VPS or personal server -> example: mongodb://<username>:<password>@<ip-or-domain>:<port>/<database>?authSource=admin

#To store GSDB data in MongoDB Atlas (version used in the delivered version of GSDB), the following steps must be followed:
#1. Create an account in MongoDB Atlas https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database 
#2. Create a free cluster, and in the menu access the Connect option
#3. Select the "connect your application" option to obtain the connection string.

#To learn more about the mongoDB connection strings, check https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/

#..............IGDB CREDENTIALS
#To connect with IGDB you must follow the steps mentioned in IGDB API Docs. 
#IGDB uses a connection through https://dev.twitch.tv/, so you must access the portal and register the application to generate the Client ID and Client Secret codes.
#For more detailed information, read https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started

#.............. VIRUSTOTAL CREDENTIALS
#To connect with VirusTotal you must create an account in their service and access the user profile. https://www.virustotal.com/gui/user/{yourUser}/apikey, where {yourUser} is the username of the registered account.
#For more information, visit https://docs.virustotal.com/
